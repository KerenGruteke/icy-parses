README for icy-parses (formerly, icToolDist)
============================================

This package provides support for extracting integration cost from the
output of the Stanford Dependency Parser.

Usage
-----

Usage for plain SENTS files:

    ./integration_cost.py SENTS_FILE OUTPUT_FILE --stories

where a `SENTS_FILE` is a standard one-sentence-per-line corpus file.
It may or may not be tokenized already.
This script assumes they are not tokenized.

For plain SENTS files and sentence-level summary output:

    ./integration_cost.py SENTS_FILE OUTPUT_FILE --sentfeats
